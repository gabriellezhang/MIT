My name is Nan Zhang and I am also called Gabrielle or Gabby or Naan bread all the time. I want to pursue a career in academic.
This is my first Github repository and my first project on Bigdata and my first time use a Linux system - Ubuntu and my first time using an IDE rather than Jupyter notebook.


It's pretty much what is happenning here and I feel more like a 80 years old lady using computer or smart phone for the fist time. God it's exiting and scary.
